              <p class="card-text">The world's climate crisis has major health implications, according to WHO, with air pollution alone killing an estimated seven million people annually. In addition, 
                more than 25% of deaths from chronic respiratory disease, heart attack, lung cancer, and stroke are attributed to the same emissions responsible for global warming, 
                WHO said. Climate change also worsens malnutrition and promotes the spread of infectious diseases, according to WHO.</p>

                WHO said it recorded a total of 978 attacks against health care workers or facilities in 11 countries last year, which resulted in 193 deaths. The conflicts also forced 
                a record number of people to leave their homes, resulting in limited health care access for tens of millions of people, WHO said.</p>
