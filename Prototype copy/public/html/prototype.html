        <h2>What do we do?</h2>
        <p>Health is the most important factor in any human life and should be treated with the utmost care at all times, everyday. Though the mortality of COVID - 19
          has dimmed down for some time now, the world still faces a great deal of health issues both physically and mentally. Even before the pandemic, major progress 
          was made in improving the health of millions of people. Significant strides were made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers 
          associated with child and maternal mortality.

    <div class="objective2">
        <h2>Panoramic</h2>
        <p>Great strides have been made in improving people’s health in recent years. 146 out of 200 countries 
            or areas have already met or are on track to meet the SDG target on under-5 mortality. The increasing scope of
            deseases warrants the improvement of the quality of services in healthcare delivery. Financial assistance to 
            public health infrastructure and efforts for poverty alleviation are critical for effective measures against infectious disease threats.</p>

            <p>It shouldn't be sidelined, however, that COVID - 19 left a noticable impact in the health of millions both mentally and
            physically. Inadequate access to healthcare systems has made it particularley difficult to access them,
            which denotes a health threat across countries. </p>

        <p>The <b><a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization (WHO)</a></b> is an important factor to this matter, as their list of biggest health changes for the next decade 
            demand the involvement of more than the health sector, but the government too should be aware of the increasing tension in the persuasion

                    more than 25% of deaths from chronic respiratory disease, heart attack, lung cancer, and stroke are attributed to the same emissions responsible for global warming, 
                    WHO said. Climate change also worsens malnutrition and promotes the spread of infectious diseases, according to WHO.</p>

                    a record number of people to leave their homes, resulting in limited health care access for tens of millions of people, WHO said.</p>
