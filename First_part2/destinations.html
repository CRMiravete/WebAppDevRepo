            One of the world's best-known commemorative monuments. The Arc de Triomphe is an iconic symbol of French national identity 
            and took 30 years to build. The Tour de France bicycle race ends near it each year, and the annual military parade marking 
            July 14—known both as French National Day and Bastille Day—begins its journey at the arch.

            Flourishing to this day at the southeastern province of Yucatán, near the border to Quintana Roo lies the archeological site 
            of Chichen Itzá (mayan ethimology that stands for "The city on the edge of the well of the Itzaes"). Officially nominated as
            one of the 7 Wonder of the World, this site bears a great cultural significance, as it was the capital of a large territory 
            in the Yucatan peninsula, headed by the Mayapan league, an architecture with astrological knowledge of unpararlleled compare
            and magnificent traces of a once flourishing civilization.

           Maglev Monorail Technology was one of those wonders which have gone dead silent in the contemporary era due to it's high cost production
           and, as such, scarce receptability of costumers; as a consecuence, no company or initative has dared to pick up the fragments of this intriguing
           tehnology, until today. The Yamanashi Maglev Test Center envisions the possibilities of transportation which said technology can benefit
           from if done correctly. They've been conducting tests since 1996, and nowadays they are ready to offer this means of trasnport to the public
           as an attraction in the meantime. What's breathtaking from this transport is that the monorail can travel at an mind - boggleling speed of
           500 km/h (310.686 miles/h), and yet it feels like travelling at normal speed on any contemporary passenger train.
